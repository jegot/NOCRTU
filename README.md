# NOCRTU
OCR reader for address blocks on PDFs

Cycles through all PDFs in a folder chosen by the user.

For each PDF, generates an image for a predetermined area of a PDF based on likelihood of address block location.

Generated image is then scanned using OCR, and extracted text is sent to a csv.
